<h2>UX Design</h2>
In the PDF file.
I kept the original design for users with wider screen, but only put the whole website into a container with 966p width, because only 30% or so user use wider screen, and the orignal design didn't bother much.</br></br>

<h5>Small Screen</h5>
As the structure of website is simple, I adopted tab bar at the bottom, so that users can easily direct to the page they want. The defult department will be All, and category abbr. will show on tab bar, so that users always know which category they are in. </br>
I changed all the combo boxes into list. When users lick on it, a larger picker will slide up at the top layer, which makes it easier to choose items.</br>
Since only few have attachment, I regarded it not as much as important than other information, and therefore put it to the bottom of the page.</br>
By clicking on the image, they will get in the gallery mode, and slide to view images, and zoom in and out. By clicking the close button at the top right, they will leave gallery mode. The mode is very common, and most people in their 20s or 30s should know that.</br>
I put all the links at the footer into account page, and adjusted group and order. The first section has the closed relation with users and they are likely to check it. The 2nd section encourages users to explore and find out more good deals, and they can push notifications. The 3rd section, though important, is less likely to be viewed and it's all about information related to company.</br>
I put log out at the very end, because I didn't want users to log out. If they log out, a big login button will show at the top of account page to motivate them to log in, and the 1st section involving user themselves will hide.
